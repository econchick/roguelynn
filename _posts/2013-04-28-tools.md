* [Homebrew][brew] for managing installations on your Mac OS.  Read about [Homebrew Demystified][brew2] on why it’s a very helpful tool.
* [Sublime Text 2][subl] – my go-to text editor. [Sublime Text 3][subl3] is out for registered users only, as well.
* [iTerm][iTerm] – great, feature-rich replacement for the Mac OS’s Terminal.app.
* [zshell][zsh] with [oh-my-zsh][ohmyz] framework for plugins and configuration. [Read this article][read] for why zshell instead of bash.
* [Dash][dash] for browsing documentation locally, with [doc2dash][doc] to generate documentation for Dash’s API.
* [Vagrant][vagrant] to manage all the virtual machines I regularly break.
