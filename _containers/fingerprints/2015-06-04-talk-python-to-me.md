In chatting with [Michael Kennedy][1] – host of [Talk Python to Me][2], we talk about how Python is used at Spotify, my role in the PSF as a Python Software Foundation board member, how I became the founder of PyLadies San Francisco, some of my talks and presentations, as well as shamelessly self-promoting some of the open source work I'm doing.
